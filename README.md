## Final Project

Please fill out the following questions before class on Tuesday morning:

### Which of the [final project prompts](https://pages.git.generalassemb.ly/guardian-jsd/public/final/) will you be making this week?

The weather app

### Why did you choose that project? Is there anything in particular about it that excites you?

I want to stretch my web development skills and build something that is focused on the UX piece rather than just satisfying the requirements to fetch data from the API and display it. I am excited to learn about working with maps as well as maybe using some cool animations.

### What do you expect to be the most difficult part?

I've never done any work with maps or geolocation before, so I expect to spend a bunch of time figuring that out.
